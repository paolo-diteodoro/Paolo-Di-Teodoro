### :man_technologist: About me :

I hold a degree in Civil Engineering, complemented by Master's degrees in Engineering Management and Financial Management. 

Additionally, I recently completed a Data Analyst bootcamp at TripleTen, where I honed my skills in Python and SQL programming. 

My academic background, combined with around eight years of experience in financial roles across industries such as Oil & Gas, Insurance, and Banking, has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of risk management, process improvement, and data analysis.

Throughout my career, I have worked in multinational companies, collaborating with cross-functional teams and senior management to enhance operational efficiencies and drive business growth. 

In my most recent position as an Operations Analyst at Santander Corporate & Investment Banking, I was responsible for managing derivative collateral operations, where I played a pivotal role in mitigating counterparty credit risk through detailed analysis and process optimization.

I am particularly skilled in planning, control, reporting, and project management, with advanced proficiency in English. 

My ability to adapt to new technologies and work in dynamic environments has been key to my success.
